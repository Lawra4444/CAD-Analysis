# A Reverse Engineering Project on a Portable speaker

This repository contains some of my CAD design portfolio on a T&G Speaker.

## Projects included:
- Picture to show the dismantled speaker
- MATLAB simulation of battery performance with details from the maufacturer's guide
- Detailed depiction of changes made to the original form of the speaker using CATIA v5
  
## Project description
- As a team, we were asked to reverse engineer any article of choice and improve upon it through sustainabily and highly ethical means
- after thorough tests and analysis
- Our improvements included: battery upgrade since the matlab simulation showed that the battery lasted only a few hours when charged, a solar panel integration, to allow for the
- introduction of renewable energy integration, to help extend the run-time and lifespan of the article.
- The outer casing was changed to a sturdy bamboo to help improve the environmental impact.
-  I redesigned the end of the speaker on CATIA and strategically added an opening to make it easier to replace components such as the battery.
